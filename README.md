# MQTT---highly-optimized-code
This is a MQTT library, highly optimized for a low space microcontroller . 

## initial problem 
A atmega328pd microcontroller based pcb needed to act as a IoT device. Since the memory was already 80%, the stack was crashing after the device was running for longer periods (18 days). hence the ram needed to be highly optimzed for libraries and hence born the 'highly optimized MQTT library'. This brough down the all memory down to 52% from 86%.
